Description: High-dimentional cytometry, including spectral flow cytometry and mass cytometry (CyTOF), enables deep immunophenotyping at a single-cell resolution. Analysis of cytometry data from multiple batches of experiments remains to be challenging due to the high-dimentionality and batch effects. We designed iMUBAC (Integration of Multi-Batch Cytometry datasets) to enable a rational and streamlined inter-batch comparisons through i) preprocessing, ii) batch-correction, iii) unsupervised clustering, and iv) batch-specific cell-type identification.
